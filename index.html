        <p class="captions-text">A redesign of the Dulcolax landing page website showcases insight on the product target demographic and how the company can convert more users to purchase. Research included data and statistics of Dulcolax and competition use, target consumer behavior, medical and sales interfaces, and landing page best practices. These insights combined to create the user flow and necessary interactions within the site.</p>

        <p><img src="dulcolax_site.png"></p>
        <p class="captions-text">As a user clicks Purchase, details open within the website to retain users, rather than linking to a retailer site. Users can choose from various online retailers to present users with a familiar source and encourage purchase. Online rather than in-store purchase is convenient for the working class target demographic of Dulcolax.</p>
        <p class="captions-text">The use of colloquial copy rather than medical terms, as well as an interactive, user-specific symptom chooser, allow the user to comfortably feel part of the prescription process.</p>
        <p><img src="dulcolax_grid.jpg"></p>
        <p class="captions-text">The target user is either uneducated or indecisive when choosing a laxative brand. The grid system limits the amount of products the user is seeing, meaning that viewable products are also the most relevant, and encourages user action to purchase. The grid reads horizontally, catering to Dulcolax's older user demographic.</p>
        <p><img src="dulcolax_1.jpg"></p>
        <p class="captions-text">Dulcolax is expensive relative to its market, so a Coupons page pushes deals and affordability to low income users.</p>
        <p><img src="dulcolax_2.png"></p>
        <p class="captions-text">A quote from a target demographic user promotes transparency and trust.</p>

        <p class="captions-text">LA Hacks @ UCLA, 2015 - 2016</p>
        <p class="captions-text">LA Hacks is UCLA's annual weekend-long hackathon with 1500 student participants and various company sponsors. LA Hacks 2016 had the goal to draw in participants ranging from students new to coding, returning coders, non-coders, and females. The hackathon's visual identity would have to advertise and reflect this as well as inspire inclusivity in the participants themselves.</p>
        <p class="captions-text">I had the chance to work as one of two Designers, as well as to build a team and set up a project timeline in terms of design deliverables and meeting with developers and fellow designers.</p>
        <p class="captions-text">When presenting design directions and updates to the large team of LA Hacks organizers, my Co-Designer and I focused validation on LA Hacks event goals, target users, and best practices. This allowed the organizational team to learn about their participants and how students could best perceive LA Hacks as inclusive and encouraging.</p>

        <p class="captions-text">Above: Ideation, design directions, initial splash page concept. Interactions mirror the quick-paced working environment of a hackathon. The side paddle interaction is controlled by keyboard and can be  a collaborative or competitive two player game, or a new and challenging single player effort.</p>
        <p class="captions-text">The landing page design and copy should generate excitement and curiosity in users familiar with LA Hacks, while also being playful and engaging enough to get shared around to new users.</p>
        <p class="captions-text"><a href="https://www.lahacks.com/2016" target="_blank">LA Hacks 2016</a></p>
        <p><img src="hacks_3.jpg"></p>
        <p class="captions-text">It was important to not only design the website but also the copy used in social media advertising and website to relfect the hackathon's goals. All participants should feel not only welcome but important to the hackathon experience, to be integrated in a non-imposing way to returning coders. These messages were emphasized in the landing page experience, because digital users are converted into hackathon participants when they sign up through the site.</p>

        <p><img src="hacks_5.jpg"></p>
        <p><img src="hacks_6.jpg"></p>
        <p class="captions-text">My Co-Designer and I worked alongside two developers, communicating any time constraints and iterating on new features side by side. As the hackathon weekend neared, two designers focused on shirt, swag, and pavilion event space design joined our meetings so that we could work side by side and incorporate our user research and hackathon goals into all aspects of design.</p>
        <p class="captions-text">From digital to physical brand recognition and participant interaction, my character design of the LA Hacks 2016 'Bruin' bear hacker mascot played a central role. The bear allowed diversity, various user types, and a personal human touch that is central to hackathons.</p>
        <p><img src="hacks_7.JPG"></p>
        <p class="captions-text">Participants' shirts have the diving coding bear, familiar from the website and playful, yet professional on a dark blue shirt. LA Hacks Organizers wear a white, approachable shirt color with a bright pink bear character and stands out in the dark pavilion event space.</p>
        <p class="captions-text">Shirt backs have the mandated list of event sponsors, to which I brough creative, relevant attention with company-inspired bear mascots.</p>
        <p class="captions-text">We took advantage of having so many bear illustrations floating around and turned them into stickers, for participants to collect and trade at and after the event.</p>
        <p><img src="hacks_8.JPG"></p>
        <p class="captions-text">Additionally for the hackathon weekend, my Co-Designer, developers and I launched a Live addition to the LA Hacks website, focusing on day-of information in quick links that can be accessed without scrolling and saved to view offline.</p>

        <p class="captions-text">Documentation of my work at Dogtown Media, a design and development agency in Los Angeles focusing on mobile start-up clients to launch App Store applications. I worked with clients both one-on-one and with the larger Dogtown team of Research, UI, and Business leads.</p>
        <p class="captions-text">Some of my responsibilities included client-onboarding, market research and analysis focusing on features, user impressions and target demographic, and product evolution, and then presenting this research as business opportunities and market and user insights to the client and fellow designers. For clients who are start-ups themselves, it was important to clearly present the process, introduce them to ux deliverables, and what is expected of all involved on the project.</p>

        <p class="captions-text">My other responsibilities included user flow, user interviews, wireframes, visual directions, UI design, and client presentations of each. For some projects I was solely in charge from client on-boarding to developer hand-off. Others ranged fro working alongside a Senior Researcher, handing off wireframes to a Visual Designer, or picking up a project from a fellow designer in varying phases such as UI Design or adding a feature. My workflow included multiple projects and clients at once.</p>

        <p class="captions-text">I additionally delivered Phase 2 client presentations, encouraging clients to focus on MVP features and highlighting opportunities for future development. In this second development phase, I worked with turning protoypes into full visual builds of an application, as well as working alongside our developer to implement a new feature in an existing App Store application with a condensed round of research, wireframing, validation, UI design, and developer hand-off.</p>

        <p class="captions-text">This is documentation of IdeanPort, my final intern project at UX Agency Idean. The task was to research, create, and validate any interface that can provide business value to the company. It involved getting to know the workflow of UX Designers at Idean, interviewing them for insight into common practices and pain points, exploring various solutions, culminating in a presentation to various team leads within Idean. My product, IdeanPort, is an internal repository for Idean, which I proposed after conducting market research of new internal company tools and interviewing Idean employees to create this company-specific solution.</p>

        <p class="captions-text">We began our teamwork over video calls, with myself in California and my four teammates in Finland. These calls allowed us to align business goals with product and user research, and develop the Elffe name, identity, and vision. </p>
        <p><img src="elffe_3.jpg"></p>
        <p class="captions-text">I shortly joined the team in the <a href="http://summerofstartups.com" target="_blank">Summer of Startups</a> workspace hosted by <a href="https://aaltoes.com/" target="_blank">Aaltoes</a> at <a href="http://www.aalto.fi/en/about/history/tkk/" target="_blank">Aalto University of Technologyin Helsinki</a>, where up to 15 startup teams from around the world have been chosen to develop their product and business, and learn alongside the startup community and industry leading mentors.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="captions-text">Elffe as a service and company is about activating and engaging senior citizens within their community through younger 'Elffe' helpers. Elffe's website needs to convey trust, incentive, and credibility, because it serves as a service introduction and the conversion of a user into a customer, as the senior's loved one orders an Elffe for the senior.</p>
        <p class="captions-text">Credibility is achieved by citing quotes, a consistent and recognizable brand image, and assigning Elffes with affiliations and seals of approval within their community.</p>
        <p><img src="elffe_2.jpg"></p>
        <p class="captions-text">The website's use of real rather than stock visual and textual narrative emphasizes atuthenticity and trust. All content is by Elffe, of Elffe. The website documents narratives from and for all users involved: the senior service receiver, the young Elffe service provider, and the loved one ordering the service.</p>

        <p class="captions-text">To begin, I familiarized myself with the #NordicMade brand. Although the group had limited visual presence apart from the existing logo, there were strong cultural themes, news presence, and community built around it. It was important to design the visuals and copy to reflect an innovative and Nordic message, not isolating any one country or company, while also considering the lively SXSW tradeshow context – playing off of #NordicMade’s limited presence allowed mystery and enticement of a new SXSW audience into the Nordic culture.</p>

        <p class="captions-text">Designing for various mediums and contexts meant translating the detailed compass design into a simpler version for print color constraints, and to maximize visibility on a small scale and from far away. User interactions with digital, tactile, carrying small handouts, and passing by large posters were considered in the visual and typography design.</p>

        <p class="captions-text">Because of the live element of SXSW, content for presentations and the companies present at them would be decided day-of. I designed two flexible and branded presentation ‘master’ slides and handed them off to the #NordicMade team via editable Google Slides, along with  steps outlining how to add content, Google font links, and example finished slides.</p>
