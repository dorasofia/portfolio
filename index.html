The official NSAC 2016 prompt was to create a marketing campaign for the following 2017 year to grow Snappleâ„¢ in the US, measured by brand relevance, purchase frequency, and 'top of mind' brand awareness. Our Strategic Planning committee involved our full team in the research process in order to deliver a campaign strategy at NSAC from narratives we all understood.</p>

We fleshed out our consumer personas and provided clips and quotes from the consumer interviews so that our campaign insights would come from narratives we all came to understand. When we handed off our research deliverables to the other subteams, we wanted to hand off an understanding of the consumers, to tell their story and have some personality to play with.</p>

My co-Designer and I paired our market research with participant feedback from LA Hacks 2015, to craft a visual style and website. As the event weekend neared, we brought in two designers to focus on apparel, event space design and videography.

        <p class="captions-text">#NordicMade is a group of various Nordic startup companies and community leaders. Although the group had limited visual presence apart from their existing logo, they had a strong news presence, <a href="http://www.nordicstartupbits.com/2017/04/18/nordicmade-sxsw-makes-nordics-different/" target="_blank">cultural themes</a>, and community of people involved.</p>
    </div>        
    <div class="captions-copy">      
        <p class="captions-text">It was important to design visuals and copy that reflect a Nordic message, that do not isolate any one country or company, and that consider the lively SXSW tradeshow context. Designing for various mediums and contexts meant designing flexible visuals and content hierarchy systems. Detailed designs had to translate into simpler versions, such as for shirt printing constraints and to maximize visibility on a small scale or from far away.</p>

        <p class="captions-text">UX/UI Designer for <a href="https://www.perpetualny.com/" target="_blank">Perpetual</a>, a digital product design agency in New York City. Timeline: 3 months, two clients. My role included user research, prototype testing, wireframes, UI design, and stakeholder communication.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="captions-copy">
        <p class="captions-text">I was the main point of contact redesigning an internal tool for our client Thomson Reuters, a multinational mass media corporation. The tool automates news stories containing live data sets for the Reuters Editorial team of journalists and editors. The redesign would replace a current code-heavy and intimidating system, and save users' time.</p>

        <p class="captions-text">Design challenges included complex user interactions such as navigating large datasets, encouraging users with limited coding experience to create and edit working code, encouraging cross-team file storage and collaboration, and reporting data connectivity errors.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="captions-copy">
        <p class="captions-text">It was important to familiarize Reuters, a large established corporation, with the agile workflow and deliverables of a UX agency. I created a Project Roadmap with design deliverables, hours estimates, and client actions. I had weekly video meetings with the Reuters Editorial and Development Team Leads from New York and London. During these meetings I validated decisions with research and best practices. The Reuters Team Leads had technical-heavy backgrounds and familiarity with business goals. Together we finalized the user flow and MVP features.</p>

    <div class="captions-copy">
        <p class="captions-text">I successfully advocated for user testing before finalizing screens for development. We needed to validate the tool's user types, goals, and current workflow frustrations. The Reuters Team Leads and I interviewed 7 Editorial Team members on-site at the Reuters office in NYC. The users clicked through our Invision prototype and voiced frustrations, hesitations, and understanding.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="captions-copy">
        <p class="captions-text">I formatted our testing results into a stakeholder presentation with actionable insights. We added one round of UX/UI iterations based on the user interview feedback. For example, we made sure to only use copywriting that was familiar rather than technical.</p>

    <div class="captions-copy">
        <p class="captions-text">I advocated to limit functionality to a focused MVP version. User adoption and widespread use were critical for the tool's success, and overwhelming functionality and business-value assumptions could risk retention. I highlighted opportunities for future features after gathering more user feedback from a working, developed tool.</p>

        <p class="captions-text">After stakeholder sign-off on the MVP, I met with the Development Team to walk through the final screens and technical specifications. A Senior Designer at Perpetual worked with me to specify navigation, actions, default states, and responsive screen states.</p>

        <p class="captions-text">Another client I worked with at Perpetual is Reliance Jio, one of India's expansive 4G lTE network providers. I took over the second phase of this project from a Senior Designer at Perpetual who had recently designed Jio Virtual Classroom for web and iOS. I worked with this Senior Designer to get a handover of project context and users. My main task was translating screens to tablet and Android.</p>

    <div class="captions-copy">
        <p class="captions-text">I worked with our client's Project Manager and Developers, based in India. Working with the time difference, it was important to share designs and ask questions a few days ahead of schedule and stay active in Slack.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="captions-copy">
        <p class="captions-text">I kept the experience familiar from web, while researching best practices for responsive sizing and mobile learning. For example, emphasizing 'live chat' can deliver text content in small, digestible chunks for mobile learning while also meeting the client's goal of real-time user interactions. For Android, primary actions need to be shown rather than hidden.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="captions-copy">
        <p class="captions-text">One challenge was working within constraints of the product's live video software, when designing overlays and interactions. And for copy, the app was designed with language translations in mind, as it would be used throughout  India, sometimes with very long words.</p>

    <div class="captions-copy">
        <p class="captions-text">I additionally produced a video teaser of the product in use, focusing on its mobile and collaborative potential in India's public schools. I storyboarded, sourced stock footage, and shot supporting scenes in our Perpetual office of the app prototype in use. I edited the video strategically, working around challenges of not being on-side at India's schools. The video was presented by the Jio Education Team to the Reliance Jio Executive Team at Jio's companywide 2016 Demo Day.</p>
