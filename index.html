The official NSAC 2016 prompt was to create a marketing campaign for the following 2017 year to grow Snappleâ„¢ in the US, measured by brand relevance, purchase frequency, and 'top of mind' brand awareness. Our Strategic Planning committee involved our full team in the research process in order to deliver a campaign strategy at NSAC from narratives we all understood.</p>

We fleshed out our consumer personas and provided clips and quotes from the consumer interviews so that our campaign insights would come from narratives we all came to understand. When we handed off our research deliverables to the other subteams, we wanted to hand off an understanding of the consumers, to tell their story and have some personality to play with.</p>

For 2016 the organizers had the goal of drawing in a range of participants, from students new to coding, to skillful returning coders, to hackathon minorities such as non-coders and females. My co-Designer and I paired our market research with participant feedback from LA Hacks 2015, to craft a visual style and website. As the event weekend neared, we brought in two designers to focus on apparel, event space design and videography. Together we incorporated the event's goals and user research throughout the hackathon experience.</p>

        <p class="captions-text">I worked with a small team of business and code developers. We began work over video calls, with myself at UCLA in California and my four teammates at Aalto University in Finland. These calls allowed us to align business goals with product and user research as we developed the name, identity, target audience and goals. I shortly joined my team in the <a href="http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/startup-sauna-s-reputation-is-heating-up/" target="_blank">Startup sauna</a> workspace, where we continued to narrow our target audience, plan content and photography shoots, and design the landing page and build it together using Webflow.</p>

Credibility on the website is achieved with quotes from all users involved: the senior service receiver, the young Elffe service provider, and the loved one ordering the service. The website uses real rather than stock visuals, and text narratives that emphasize authenticity and trust. All content is by Elffe, of Elffe. We also marked our Elffe helpers with affiliations and seals of approval from within their community, such as university and scout badges.</p>

        <p class="captions-text">Graphic design is a way for me to visually communicate the experience of a story, a feeling, a message. My <a href="http://dma.ucla.edu/undergrad/program/" target="_blank">Design Media Arts (DMA)</a> Bachelors program at UCLA (University of California Los Angeles) was four years of intensive studio classes. Brainstorming, creating, and critiquing allowed me to build a strong foundation in basics such as form, color, hierarchy, typography, and motion. I grew confident in my message and style. DMA studio classes have a balance of projects that rely on self-discipline and creativity, group critiques for insights into one anothers' ways of thinking, and guidance from a talented professor in the field.</p>

        <p class="captions-text">I began by incorporating the user into my projects, thinking of how my design was being experienced and why.

I felt the responsibility to use my skills in editing, interaction design, and research for a purpose&mdash;for exhibition visitors to visually experience with me this cognitive dissonance between personal vs environmental, societal responsibility that many students and young people today feel the pressure of.</p>

        <p class="captions-text">DMA allowed me to explore my background in video and editing, which I had been passionate about since directing my friends in middle school to then <a href="https://www.freestyleacademy.rocks/Film/" target="_blank">studio Film classes in high school</a>. My talented DMA professors gave critique in terms of form, emotion, detail. We were challenged to create videos from a vague prompt such as 'Red', or 'Light &amp; motion'. Below is a video where I was able to showcase my strong editing style, utilise my experience working with actors, and challenge my eye for detail.</p>

        <p class="captions-text">Vivgo aims to alieve a lack of access to local, authentic experiences as a traveler or student abroad. As a team we met once a week to share research and findings from each of our unique backgrounds (market research, legal, development contraints, design opportunities, etc). We focused the scope of the app; we were not in the business of tourist attractions, and had to have a realistically populated app on-launch, from which we could later scale up. Our MVP target demographic was the foreign-exchange student community at UCLA. We <a href="https://www.facebook.com/vivgoapp/" target="_blank">began building our community</a>, and our startup was ultimately put on hold when our team went our different ways after graduating.</p>

Designing for various mediums and contexts meant designing flexible visuals and content hierarchy systems. Detailed designs had to translate into simpler versions, such as for shirt printing constraints and to maximize visibility on a small scale or from far away.</p>
